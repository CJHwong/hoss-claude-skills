# sort-later

Organize bookmarks from any source into articles and functional sites.

Takes a pile of bookmarks — browser exports, Pocket, Raindrop, Instapaper, or plain URL lists — and splits them into two buckets:

- **Articles** (things you read) get scraped, converted to markdown, and organized into an Obsidian vault with concept tags and backlinks
- **Functional sites** (things you use) become a tidy browser-importable HTML bookmark file with sensible folders

Also handles deduplication, dead link detection, and tag cleanup.

## Examples

**Import browser bookmarks:**
> "I exported my Chrome bookmarks, help me sort through them."

**Process a read-later export:**
> "Here's my Pocket export, do something with it."

**Build an Obsidian vault:**
> "I've got 500 saved articles, turn them into something I can search."
